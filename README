Program to show "Chaotic" Fractal generation. Generates both Barnsley's Fern and Sierpinksi Triangle bases on 
random number generation. Point of project was to experiment with the math behind the fractals, not graphics. 


TO RUN. 

In Main: 
Lines 42 & 43 control which fractal is generated. 


Created for my own fun :).
